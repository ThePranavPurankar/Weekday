"Zomatos mission statement is better food for more people. Since our inception in 2010, we have grown tremendously, both in scope and scale - and emerged as Indias most trusted brand during the pandemic, along with being one of the largest hyperlocal delivery networks in the country.

Today, Zomato represents a wide range of cultures through its diversified 5000+ team members, 3.5 lakh+ delivery partners, and our biggest collective of the finest restaurant partners. We are grateful that our business is able to provide upward social and economic movement for millions of households  of our delivery partners, as well as restaurant staff. We think of all of us as one big family!

Our passion is driven by purpose and we take immense pride in our initiative Feeding India, one of Indias largest not-for-profits working to ensure that nobody in India goes to bed hungry. As of now, Feeding India provides over 150,000 nutritious meals to the underprivileged every day.

In April 2020, Feeding India ran one of the largest food distribution drives in the world during the first wave of COVID, and distributed 78 million meals to daily wagers across the length and breadth of the country.

During the second wave of COVID-19, Feeding India was again the first to act. We were able to source over 9,000 oxygen concentrators and distributed them for free to government hospitals across the country. This helped save millions of lives during one of the worst humanitarian crises faced by India in the recent times.

Were innovating hard to make last-mile delivery carbon neutral, to eliminate the use of plastic packaging, create meaningful opportunities in the gig economy, and to feed our countrys ever-growing appetite for high-quality, affordable, and hygienic food, one delivery at a time!",,422813,"2023-10-02T05:48:12.662Z","Startups, Sustainability, Sales, Ecommerce, Food, Delivery, Operations, Technology, Engineering, Internet services, Farming, Logistics, Digital advertising, New business development, Online Classifieds, Restaurant Search & Discovery, Table Reservations, Restaurant POS System, Food ordering online, Ingredients supply, Online consumer insights, Restaurant Rating and Reviews","zomato.com","zomato","IN","1,001-5,000 employees","Zomato","Gurugram, Haryana","2023-10-02T17:10:49.292Z",10929,"https://www.linkedin.com/company/zomato/"

We believe in Think Passion. People who make a difference by building products that they care about, people who care about their users, about their code and the impact they have. 

Our Platform 

99tests platform gives software product developers the ability to compress long testing cycles to short bursts. The first advantage is that, a large number of defects can be uncovered in a short time, enabling a quicker time-to-market.
Another advantage is the on-demand access to global community of testers. Since there is a direct correlation between the number of testers testing a software & the number of defects that can be uncovered, software entrepreneurs can add many skilled testers to test their product instantly.  All this without hiring more people.
Lastly we follow a pay-for-results model. Unlike outsourcing, where payment is based on number of hours clocked in, testers at 99tests are rewarded based on the results of their testing effort. Allowing you to monitor & consume the testing effort in a result-oriented manner.

"Adya helps enterprises manage and secure their SaaS applications. 

As enterprises move to cloud applications - GSuite, O365, Slack, etc - they find it difficult to administer this SaaS sprawl. They are confronted with three problems: 

a) Administration: Each new SaaS application brings with it a new management console that an admin has to get familiar with and repeat the same set of steps. This is a waste of time & is error-prone.

b) License Management: While the per-month/ per-user pricing of SaaS apps starts off looking inexpensive, the costs spiral quickly with more users and more SaaS apps. 

c) Security and Compliance : Cloud applications make it very easy to collaborate and to share data widely.  IT would like to know what data is shared, which external users have access and which users are exposing data.

Adya solves these problems. We provide a single tool with the following benefits:

1. Central Administration: Perform the most critical and oft-repeated tasks from a single console to save time and to reduce administrator errors.

2. Security and Compliance: Understand where sensitive data is, who outside the company has access, who inside the company has been sharing it and take steps to prevent it. Get alerted in real-time if sensitive data is exposed..

3. Auditing and Reporting: Get pre-defined & custom reports to understand activity of privileged users, of employees on their way out the door, consultants etc. Prepare reports quickly to satisfy your auditor on who has access to critical data  no matter where in the cloud that data may be.

4. License Management: Understand how many licenses are provisioned for your critical (and expensive!) SaaS applications and get alerted if licenses are under-utilized to find potential savings. Manage your licenses from a single console and get an impartial and independent third party to help save you money.

In a development or migration program, through use of its P-A-S-S assurance platform Avekshaa is able to identify and solve serious Architecture - Design - Code issues much earlier in the development life cycle, as against discovering it during testing, through use of its unique Modelling approach, thereby saving costly delays, avoiding missing business deadlines, or cost escalations.

Our USP is a proprietary P-A-S-S Assurance platform, using which we continuously manage, improve and assure the Performance, Availability and Scalability of complex Enterprise applications.  

We have prevented and solved Resiliency, Scalability and Performance problems for some of the most complex IT systems in the world.

"Baaz helps retail brands & stores transform boring & traditional eCommerce stores into interactive ones with a no-code SaaS tool.

eCommerce today, is no longer enough for merchants as well as customers in its current shape and form. The online shopping experience hasn't improved much in a long time, it lacks trust, it lacks emotional connect & is very transactional. The online shopping experience is still predominantly dependent on photos, texts & search. 

It is becoming increasingly expensive for businesses to run their online stores with low conversion rates, less engagements and low-profit margins. Selling online is no longer the ideal solution. Simply put it is very inefficient. This is a huge global problem and an opportunity. The problem is hard, requires dedication, grit and world class execution. 

@Baaz we are combining eCommerce with interactive storytelling. In essence, we're rethinking the entire online shopping experience from the ground up keeping trust, storytelling and a superior shopping experience at the center.

"Ask any CIO about corporate data and theyll happily share all the work theyve done to make their databases secure and compliant. Ask them about other sensitive information, like contracts, financial documents, and source code, and youll probably get a much less confident response. Few organizations have any insight into business-critical information stored in unstructured data.

There was a time when that didnt matter. Those days are gone. Data is now accessible, copious, and dispersed, and it includes an alarming amount of business-critical information. Its a target for both cybercriminals and regulators but securing it is incredibly difficult. Its the data challenge of our generation.

Existing approaches arent doing the job. Keyword searches produce a bewildering array of possibly relevant documents that may or may not be business critical. Asking users to categorize documents requires extensive training and constant vigilance to make sure users are doing their part. Whats needed is an autonomous solution that can find and assess risk so you can secure your unstructured data wherever it lives.

Thats our mission.

First, most of the water you get in plastic cans isnt fit for drinking. Second, less than 5% of Indians actually own a water purifier! Thats when we realised this wasnt just a personal problem but an opportunity to help a lot of people.

*Complete Travelogue: Check-ins are temporary. Explurge-Ins are forever. Every time you create a post i.e. Explurge you make, the Artificial Intelligence updates you personalized Travelogue. So every mile, city, country, pub, club and what not you have been to adds up to it. 

*Future Travel Plans: The next time you feel like telling the world about your travel plans, well you can do it even before you travel. All you need to do is select a destination, enter the future date of travel and tap Spread. A Live Countdown Timer will engage everyone. Maybe you can use a few suggestions, tips and envy that pours in!

*Explurger Levels: Gamifying travel for the very first time, now you can increase your Explurger level. How? Every single mile you travel, city you visit, post you spread or Kudos you accumulate, the excitement goes up and so does your Explurger level!

"Farmveda (www.farmveda.in), is a for-profit social enterprise founded by Dr. Trilochan Sastry (professor, IIM Bangalore) in 2016 with investments from the Tata Trust and Infosys founders. He started working for farmers way back in 2003 through an NGO he set up called Centre for Collective Development (www.ccd.ngo). This organization promotes cooperatives and supports over 40,000 farmers as of today. After seeing the success of CCD, Farmveda was established with the mission of taking farmers further up the value chain. This was achieved by establishing a branded food manufacturing company (much along the lines of what Amul is to dairy farmers). Currently, Farmveda has traditional breakfast mixes and podis to offer. Some snacks and condiments are in the pipeline. Our USP is preservative-free, homemade-taste, nutritious food. Recently some peanut based products such as chocolate coated peanuts, roasted peanut chocolate bar and peanut butter have also been launched.

Today there are over 30000 + farmers working together across 3 districts. The movement is slowly spreading to other States.


As of now, only the profit goes to the farmers. In the long run, the ownership will also entirely go the farmers of India.  Thats why we say:

"""Indian industries are huge consumers of waterand are facing increasingly stringent regulations to reduce water consumption, and even production downtime due to water scarcity. Large buildings and campuses in various parts of India increasingly have to buy tanker water which is expensive and often, low quality water. Water stress will only increase in coming years, not because we have a water shortage, but because we use water irresponsibly and manage it poorly. Water distribution pipelines in cities, for example, have leakages equal to 25-40%. Not only does this waste water, but also the energy that is needed to lift and transport water long distances. The True Cost of water is, indeed, very high.  

 

FluxGen's Water Intelligence SaaS Platform AquaGen leverages IoT, AI and Distributed Ledger to tracking, measure and analysing water consumption data, and uses to identify ways to reduce usage and wastage. Thus, we reduce the cost of water for our clients and help industries become more responsible and sustainable, and well as de-risking from water crisis.  

 

The system is operating at 60+ industrial siteour clients include food processing plants, metals and mining sites, pharmaceutical factories and commercial buildings. Installing AquaGen takes only a few days and clients get detailed data and recommendations which can be used to meet statutory reporting requirements as well. We have helped clients save up to 30% of their water consumption, and we have a vision that companies will become water positive in the future. Our near-term goal is to help save 1 Billion litres of Water per day!

"In early 2008 Mr. C S Sudheer (Founder of IndianMoney.com) happened to meet an auto driver while working in a top MNC Broking house. The auto driver told him that one of the sales persons from his organization has sold him an insurance policy promising that ""If you pay Rs 25,000 once, you will get back Rs 1 lakh after 3 years"".

Mr. Sudheer knew there was no such policy available. When he read the policy document he realized that it was a Regular Premium ULIP policy, where customer has to pay Rs 25,000 each for 3 years. Based on the market performance, customer ""might"" get back Rs 50,000 or Rs 75,000 or Rs 1 lakh after 3 years.

It was clear that the humble auto driver wasn't made aware of the terms and conditions and complete details of the policy. It was literally impossible for an auto driver in Bangalore to save Rs. 25,000 a year for the rest of the installments. This incident shook Mr. Sudheer, he knew that there was a need for genuine, honest and unbiased financial advice and he instantly started thinking for a solution to end this problem. That's when IndianMoney.com was conceptualized, to end the unethical sales practices which are mostly in practice in the Financial Services Industry.

Mr. Sudheer paid Rs. 25,000 to the auto driver so that he at least recovers the money he had put into and also submitted his resignation to his CEO.

"Intain is building Intelligent Blockchains for transparency and efficiency in capital market transactions, with initial focus on asset-backed investments.

Asset-backed investment volumes (including mortgage-backed securities and other financings) have touched pre-crisis levels, but the only major change since the financial crisis is an increased compliance burden, with little in terms of transparency or improved efficiency. Between the issuance and ongoing management of these investments, anywhere between four to eight intermediaries get involved with annual costs in excess of $30B across Securitization and other financing.
 
Intain gets lenders, issuers, investors and other parties like servicers, trustees and rating agencies on a shared-data platform for these transactions that uses artificial intelligence and certain features of blockchain for:
      seamless flow of data with zero reconciliation
      complete transparency with provenance of asset and data

"Jawaharlal Nehru University is the foremost university in India, and a world-renowned centre for teaching and research. Ranked number one in India by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with a Grade Point of 3.91 (on a scale of 4), JNU was ranked no 3 among all universities in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework, Government of India, in 2016 and no 2 in 2017. JNU also received the Best University Award from the President of India in 2017.
Still a young university, established by an act of Parliament in 1966, the strength, energy, and reputation of Jawaharlal Nehru University result from the vision that ideas are a field for adventure, experimentation and unceasing quest, and that diversity of opinions are the basis for intellectual exploration. JNU is the place for the intellectually restless, the insatiably curious, and the mentally rigorous, giving them the space to grow amidst the calmness of an oasis, a green lung within the hustle and bustle and the crowds of the capital city of India.
Coming into being in 1969, three years after its establishment by Parliament, JNU brought frontier disciplines and newer perspectives for old disciplines to the Indian university system. The excellent teacher-student ratio at 1:10, the mode of instruction which encourages students to explore their own creativity instead of reproducing received knowledge, and of exclusively internal evaluation, were also new to the Indian academic landscape and have stood the test of time. The very Nehruvian objectives embedded in the founding of the University  national integration, social justice, secularism, the democratic way of life, international understanding and a scientific approach to the problems of society, had built into them constant and energetic endeavour to renew knowledge through self-questioning.","Higher Education",85648343,"2023-10-02T16:49:53.000Z","","jnu.ac.in","jawaharlal-nehru-university-new-delhi","IN","501-1,000 employees","Jawaharlal Nehru University","New Delhi, Delhi","2023-10-02T17:10:52.261Z",28,"http://www.linkedin.com/company/jawaharlal-nehru-university-new-delhi"

"Mego - Big Data Alter-ego for Business Management:

We are a team of Big Data and Business Strategy evangelists. We build enterprise data based strategy tools that help Senior Business Management in their Daily planning and Decision making.

All the world's slice-&-dice systems and MISs are not enough to cater the needs of Senior management. If you are a C-level executive at a data mature company, this must come as no surprise to you.

Every business needs Decision Support Systems(DSS) that can derive predictive signals, analyse opportunity & related costs/risks, and assist managment in improving processes.

The unfortunate absence of these DSS has brought AI into lime light one step early. The truth of the matter is, AI is nothing but a machine learning algorithm that is applied on the decisions that are collected as data points from your decision support system.

Mego- is a DSS with a Do It Yourself Big-Data Analytics Toolkit. No-Coding, No-Jargon, pure business value.

It provides all the software support you need to make a business decision.

The required Business Contextualisation is done by the veterans with more than 2 decades experience in the field of data intelligence and decision science. 

Mego is equipped with very powerful strategy tools and business algorithms configured and customized for your business. These algorithms and tools can be chained together to build very complex business scenarios as intuitively as a kid builds Lego Blocks using lego bricks. 

Many senior managers and executives in organizations are aggressively pursuing AI. Mego is a necessary step in doing that. With so much data to consider before making a decision, Managers are solving less number of problems every day, while becoming more and more busy.

Transforming data richness into business enrichment:
Work with Big Data yourself without any technical assistance. Earn back the dexterity with insights and the fun of strategy planning.
